        After amzing two years i got chance to move to united states.And i stayed in califorina for about 1 year. life in united state was little bit difficult because it was a paradigm shift for me i have to learn new culture new life style new. after time i learned everything step by step and it was very amazing. Being in united states opens doors to alot of oppurtunity to work to get educated. So am taking this chance to change my life thats am here trying my best!!  </p>
